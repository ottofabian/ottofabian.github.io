# About Me

I am currently a PhD student at the [Bosch Center for AI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) and member of the [Industry-on-Campus](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/excellence-strategy/research/industry-on-campus/) collaboration at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://tuebingen.ai/). 
I am supervised by Gerhard Neumann from the [Autonomous Learning Robots Lab](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/). 

I received my BSc in software engineering from [DHBW Mannheim]() and my MSc in computer science from [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) where I worked in the [Intelligent Autonomous Learning Lab](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) under Jan Peters, in the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab](https://ml-research.github.io/) under Kristian Kersting, and in the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) under Iryna Gurevych.

# Research

My passion for reinforcement learning began when I first saw an agent effortlessly master a simple cartpole task. 
Although the task is not inherently challenging, I was captivated by the seemingly flawless and precise behavior of the agent, which compelled me to take a deeper dive into reinforcement learning.
I was motivated to explore the potential of reinforcement learning and find ways to improve these agents to potentially achieve "superhuman" behavior that could perform even more challenging tasks and ultimately make our lives easier.
While there is still a long way to go, I am excited to be a part of this journey.

Specifically, my research focuses on deep reinforcement learning and algorithm development, with an emphasis on addressing key challenges such as sample complexity, learning stability, representation learning, as well as safe and efficient exploration. 
Through my work, I aim to improve the capabilities and efficiency of reinforcement learning systems, advance our understanding of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and develop innovative solutions to challenges influenced by real-world robotics applications and other complex problems in various domains.
